The guides I used to figure out git

I used this for the installation of git but everything else on the page I felt was useless

This is the video that allowed me to actually understand how the version control works in action:

(unfortunately its in mac commands but its still useful to know the idea)
The way i initialized my local git repository was to navagate to my MATLAB folder in the terminal using the 'cd' command. 
THEN, INTEAD OF USING "git init" I DID "git clone <this repository clone url>". This is because Internally, git clone 
first calls git init to create a new repository.

The first 5 minuets of this video helped me out too

Once things get going this video shows how it works on matlab (although its not really necessary at the moment, as long as you
right click on the file in the matlab library the commands are pretty self-explanatory (essentailly you will never have to do
the commands the in the 2nd video again since you can do them all in matlab)
